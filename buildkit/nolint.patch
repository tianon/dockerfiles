Description: forcibly disable the linter in the dockerfile frontend (BUILDKIT_SYNTAX=tianon/buildkit)
Author: Tianon Gravi <admwiggin@gmail.com>
Forwarded: no; upstream included this linter and enabled it by default intentionally

Ideally, this would be disabled in such a way that it was merely disabled-by-default and could be re-enabled at runtime (opt-in instead of opt-out), but the code is byzantine enough that I wasn't able to find a simple/clean way to accomplish that (and being able to do so does not appear to be a goal of upstream's implementation).

Alternatively, it would be interesting to try and remove *all* the code (instead of just making it no-op quickly), but the binary size reduction from doing so would probably not be large enough to justify the added burden of maintaining a more complex patch.
